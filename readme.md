# Traffic Lights

Simple deployable traffic lights that can be interacted with to control the flow of AI traffic.

The menu has options for Green, Red, Yellow Flashing, Race Start lights.

Player places a stopping point, which dictates where traffic will stop when the light is red.

While the script doesnt limit you to putting one traffic light down, its recommended to only control one at a time for the time being.
